## About Me
Hi, I'm **Daniel Wang**. I am a graduate from White Oaks Secondary School, Ontario, and an upcoming student at University of Guelph. I enjoy doing random coding, currently in unity. I also like to go out hiking and enjoy nature.

## About The Project
This project, *The Impact of Covid-19 on Various Student's Educational Stress*, examines the stress levels of students before and after Covid-19, categorizing the stress levels from different sources, and how far they were impacted.

## Goals
* Show that there was an increase in stress levels during the pandemic
* Examine the extend of an impact Covid had on students
  + This depends on if there is a significant correlation established
