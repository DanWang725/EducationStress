I enjoy doing random coding, currently in unity. I also like to go out hiking, and enjoy nature.\r\nAbout The Project\r\nThis project, The Impact of Covid-19 on Various Student’s Educational Stress, examines the stress levels of students before and after Covid-19, categorizing the stress levels from different sources, and how far they were impacted.\r\nGoals\r\nDetermine if there was a change in student’s wellbeings after covid\r\nExamine the extend of an impact Covid had on students\r\nThis depends on if there is a significant correlation established\r\n\r\nKane’s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Prior to the lockdown, the average stress rating was located in the lower half of the distribution. The change resulted in a distribution that was skewed towards the higher levels. The homework stress had a higher average compared to the classwork stress both before and during Covid-19.\r\nThis graph splits the responses up by the respondent’s current learning environment to show if different environments experienced stress differently\r\nGraph 2\r\nThis graph splits the responses up by the respondent’s current learning environment to show if different environments experienced stress differently\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite fewer data points\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
