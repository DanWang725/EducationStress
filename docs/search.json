I enjoy doing random coding, currently in unity. I also like to go out hiking, and enjoy nature.\r\nAbout The Project\r\nThis project, The Impact of Covid-19 on Various Student’s Educational Stress, examines the stress levels of students before and after Covid-19, categorizing the stress levels from different sources, and how far they were impacted.\r\nGoals\r\nShow that there was an increase in stress levels during the pandemic\r\nExamine the extend of an impact Covid had on students\r\nThis depends on if there is a significant correlation established\r\n\r\nKane’s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Prior to the lockdown, the average stress rating was located in the lower half of the distribution. The change resulted in a distribution that was skewed towards the higher levels. The homework stress had a higher average compared to the classwork stress both before and during Covid-19.\r\nThis graph splits the responses up by the respondent’s current learning environment to show if different environments experienced stress differently\r\nGraph 2\r\nThis graph splits the responses up by the respondent’s current learning environment to show if different environments experienced stress differently\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompared to the first graph, the environment with the highest amount of people in it has similar distributions. Despite fewer data points for the hybrid and physical spaces, there are a few differences between them. Students in physical learning environments had the highest average stress level with class work. Students in virtual learning spaces experienced less stress when compared to the homework stress.\r\nGraph 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a difference between the distribution of stress levels, Females experienced on average a lower stress around classwork compared to males. Males experienced higher stress levels compared to females\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
